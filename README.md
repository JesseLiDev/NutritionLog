Nutiriton Log is a CRUD web application made with HTML, CSS, and Javascript. 

The application is capable of having users create nutrition data (calories, protien, carbs, and fats), save this data in the heroku database, update to change existing values, and delete existing data.

As of November 2022, this application is no longer hosted due to heroku increasing the cost of hosting websites on their servers.
